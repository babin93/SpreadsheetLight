SpreadsheetLight is an open source Open XML spreadsheet .NET library written in C#, and is released under the MIT License. You can create new Open XML spreadsheets, or work with existing Open XML spreadsheets that are compatible with Microsoft Excel 2007/2010/2013 and LibreOffice Calc.

No Office/Excel Interop needed. You do not need Microsoft Office/Excel to be installed.

This is a fork of Vincent Tan's Spreadsheet Light <https://github.com/babin93/SpreadsheetLight>

It is available as the `SpreadsheetLight.Fork` [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpreadsheetLight/)

I havn't been able to contact Vincent Tan yet. At the moment, it would be preferable to limit contributions to bug fixes or small enhancements
